# Welcome to the Scripts folder!  

Here you can find all the relevant code used to analyze the data and arrive at the results (+ produce the figures) reported in the manuscript.  

1) The `connectome_workbench_revisited.sh` script takes the HCP resting-state `*_dtseries.nii` data and converts it into parcellated (Schaefer Atlas, 200 brain regions, see *Methods*) `*_pconn.nii`.
   
2) The `Optimal_G_value_for_specific_subjects.py` script sweeps through a range of G values (global scaling parameter), revealing how G influences the dynamics of the model. This exploration sheds light on G's impact on simulated brain dynamics, including synchronization, information flow, and network connectivity. The G sweep is crucial for navigating the parameter space and identifying the optimal G value that aligns the simulated neural population dynamics with real rs-fMRI data. This iterative parameter optimization enhances the model's fidelity in replicating empirical observations, providing a more accurate representation of underlying neural processes.

3) The `WWD_BOLD_sims.py` script generates the simulated resting-state BOLD time series using the TVB Python library (see *Methods*). This script can manipulate the inhibitory parameters to generate the corresponding outputs found in the *Data* folder.

4) The `Control_analysis_rWW.py` script does the same thing *3* except it does so for the excitatory parameter - W<sub>E</sub>.

5) The `Jupyter_NB_for_results_replication.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains the relevant code to use the data generated by the above scripts (*3, 4*) and produce the figures seen in the Manuscript. For added, convenience this Data from our original simulations can be found within the *Data* folder.
   
**NOTE:** `Jupyter_NB_for_results_replication.ipynb` uses the &lambda; inhibitory parameter as an example. Feel free to swap this out for W<sub>I</sub>, W<sub>E</sub>, with J<sub>NMDA</sub> removed, with J<sub>i</sub> removed.
