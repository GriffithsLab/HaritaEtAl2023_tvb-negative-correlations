# Welcome to the Scripts folder!  

Here you can find all the code used to analyze the data and arrive at the results reported in the manuscript.  

There are two types of scripts here:  

1) Code - (files ending in '.py', '.sh')  

The '.sh' file contains code that parcellates empirical HCP data (.sh file)
The '.py' files carry out a G sweep for the RWW (and JR) model. The code for running the simulations in TVB with the RWW (and JR) model can also be found in the corresponding '.py' files. 

2) Jupyter Notebooks - (files ending in '.ipynb')  

Jupyter notebooks are used mainly to plot/visualize the resulting simulations from TVB and to carry out any relevant statistics.
