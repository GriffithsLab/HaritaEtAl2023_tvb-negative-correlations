# Welcome to the Scripts folder!  

Here you can find all the relevant code used to analyze the data and arrive at the results (+ produce the figures) reported in the manuscript.  

There are two types of scripts here:  

1) The `Optimal_G_value_for_specific_subjects.py` script sweeps through a range of G values (global scaling parameter), revealing how G influences the dynamics of the model. This exploration sheds light on G's impact on simulated brain dynamics, including synchronization, information flow, and network connectivity. The G sweep is crucial for navigating the parameter space and identifying the optimal G value that aligns the simulated neural population dynamics with real rs-fMRI data. This iterative parameter optimization enhances the model's fidelity in replicating empirical observations, providing a more accurate representation of underlying neural processes.
